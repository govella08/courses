students (first_name, middle_name, last_name, dob, pob, nationality, marital_status, phone, email, current_address, photo)
relatives (first_name, last_name, primary_phone, secondary_phone)
relative_student (relative_id, student_id, relationship)

---------------------------------------------
DEPARTMENT (code, name)
COURSE (code, name, duration, fee, department_id) : show, edit, update, delete
TOPICS (name, course_id)


batch:
name, start_date, end_date, course_id

NEXT CONTROLLER: InstructorController, relationships with: department, batch
Instructor (name, email, phone

Users: name, sex, email, phone, department_id
Roles: admin, coordinator, dept_coordinator, rector, hod, account

CORRECTION: Change students migration use name instead of first_name, middle_name and last_name


ACHIEVED SO FAR:
Departments: add
Users: register to departments, assign role of instructor upon registrations,
Students: add students, list students info
Relatives: add relatives, assign students to their relatives
Courses: add to departments
Topics: add topics to courses
Batches: add batches to courses, populate students to batch, list batch info
Roles: add roles through db seeder



PROBLEMS:
How do I effectively add batch_id when saving payments receipt?
When adding a student in Batch 2 who's already in Batch 1, the payments from Batch 1 appears in Batch 2
